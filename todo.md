# Figures left:
Barcodes
ITOL
Secondary metabolites
Percentage of shared species (ISS OSS etc - inflow and outflow species)
coabundance/functional clusters - network analysis - lookup walktrap! - finds functional clusters - jaccard index
mjapping rate to IGC2 catalog - see atlas
spearmans clustermap with msp vs metadata
volcano plot of gene related information and species!
Random forset + metrics
Adjusted odds ratio
Relative expression ordering

look at:
mophyl (taxonomic annotation)
moclust (gene clustering into MGS)
mecos (ecosystem network)
mopred (prediction models)

# in order
fix downstream
run downstream on gut
use updated downstream for secondary metabolites

#old
Mapping against different pathogen catalogs
Plotting (most important first):
MELD (model for end stage liver disease - evaluates severity)
	how does MELD score correlate with distance from healthy cluster
	- a function of billiruben, creatine, and INR
CRP (C reactive protein)

# todo here
Mappings for the oral catalog
Do the resistotypes, enterotype, and ortotype
Fix the machine learning part of the script
Fix adjusted odds ratio
